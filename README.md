# Quizzacious
This is an open-source quiz app for iOS. As it stands, it presents 10 questions from a category of the user's choosing, presents a list of possible answers, and prints a score at the end. The quiz API that is consumed by this application can be found [here](https://opentdb.com/).

Feel free to add to this as you see fit. It was the final project for an iOS/Swift class, but now it can be whatever you want it to be.
